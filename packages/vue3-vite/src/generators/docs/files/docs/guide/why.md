# Why Vitepress

We use Vitepress for documentation because our existing frontend projects use Vite + Vue3, so we're able to reuse styles and components. It's very lightweight as well, only one top level package is added to the monorepo `package.json`.

While Vitepress is still immature, it's stable enough for displaying basic developer documentation.
